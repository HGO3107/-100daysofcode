I have decided to involve myself in the #100daysofcode challenge to improve my firmware skills,
The rules for the challenge are:
* coding for atleast 1hour in a day.
* share your progress online

DAY1
*The codes run without error
*when i uploaded it to the microcontroller and interfaced the uC with neccessary peripherals, it didn't work.

I later realised the 4 digit seven segment display i used was a common anode type, whereby i wrote the code for common cathode type.

DAY2:
The circuit diagram is now corrected to matched for the common anode seven segment display, so as is the firmware.
